# Timeline Component - README

## Implementation Highlights
- Responsive Zoom: The zoom functionality works correctly by scaling the timeline width and height proportionally with animations for smooth user experience.
- Clean Date Visualization: The timeline header displays date markers with vertical lines, making it easy to understand the time scale.
- Interactive Editing: You can edit timeline items inline with proper keyboard support (Enter to save, Escape to cancel).
- Performance Considerations: Avoids unnecessary re-renders.

## What I Would Change
- Add Drag-and-Drop Functionality: Allow users to reposition items by dragging, which would make the timeline more interactive.
- Implement Responsive Design: Better handle different screen sizes, especially on mobile devices.

## Design Decisions
- User Experience First: The zoom controls are prominently placed and clearly labeled. Editing is initiated with a simple click and supports keyboard navigation.
- Visual Clarity: Chose a blue color scheme that's easy on the eyes. Added vertical lines in the header to clearly mark dates. Used ellipsis for long text to maintain clean layout.
- Performance Considerations: Avoided unnecessary state updates.
- Maintainability: Separated concerns with clear component structure. Used descriptive variable names. Added comments for readability.

## Testing Approach
### Given more time, I would implement the following tests:
- Unit Tests:
  - Test the lane assignment logic with various item configurations;
  - Test the date calculation logic with edge cases (leap years, month boundaries);
  - Test the zoom functionality at different scale levels;

- Integration Tests:
  - Verify that editing an item updates the timeline correctly;
  - Check that the header renders dates correctly across different time ranges;

- End-to-End Tests:
  - Test the complete user flow: load timeline, zoom, edit an item;
  - Test responsive behavior at different screen sizes;

- Visual Regression Tests:
  - Capture screenshots of different states (zoomed in/out, with edits);
  - Compare against baselines to detect visual regressions;

- Performance Tests:
  - Measure rendering time with increasing numbers of items;
  - Verify memory usage doesn't grow unexpectedly;
